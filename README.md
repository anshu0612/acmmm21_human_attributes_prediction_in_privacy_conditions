## ACM MM'21: Human Attributes Prediction UNder Privacy-preserving Conditions
We built the Context-guided Human Attributes Prediction Network (CHAPNet) guided by out human findings. We utilized the psychophysics observations for emotion, age, and gender prediction to design CHAPNet, an end-to-end multi-tasking human attributes classification depp learning model. The advantage of basing our model design on human behaviour is that it makes the network architecture explainable.
